# Credit Card Default

## Problem Statement
Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the
incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the
biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The
goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's
characteristics and payment history.

## Variable Description
* ID: ID of each client
* LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit
* SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)
* EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others, 5=unknown, 6=unknown)
* MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)
* AGE: Age in years
* PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, â€¦ 8=payment delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)
* PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)
* PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)
* PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)
* PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)
* PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)
* BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
* BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
* BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
* BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
* BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
* BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
* PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
* PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
* PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
* PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
* PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
* PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)

## Project Approach
1. Data Ingestion:
    * In Data Ingestion phase the data is first read as csv.
    * Then the data is split into training and testing and saved as csv file.

2. Data Transformation:

    * In this phase a ColumnTransformer Pipeline is created.
    * For Numeric Variables Standard Scaling is performed on data.
    * For Categorical Variables first One Hot Encoding is performed followed by Standar Scaling.
    * This preprocessor is saved as a pickle file.

3. Model Training:

    * In this phase base model is tested.
    * After this hyperparameter tuning is performed.
    * This model is saved as a pickle file.

4. Prediction Pipeline:

    * This pipeline converts given data into dataframe and has various functions to load pickle files and predict the final results in python.

5. Flask App creation:
    * Flask app is created with User Interface to predict whether the client will default or not inside a Web Application.
